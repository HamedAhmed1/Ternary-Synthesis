# Ternary-Synthesis
Synthesis_Algorithm.py is the main synthesis code which generates a TBDD graph for a given ternary function.
NetList_Gen.py is the is the netlist generation code which takes the graph and generates a netlist with 2:1 Multiplexers as submodules.
main.py calls the above two modules to generate netlist for benchmark ternary functions.
